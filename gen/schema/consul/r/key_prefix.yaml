arguments:
  path_prefix:
    required: true
    help: (Required) Specifies the common prefix shared by all keys that will be managed
      by this resource instance. In most cases this will end with a slash, to manage
      a "folder" of keys.
    type: Text
  token:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The ACL token to use. This overrides the token that the agent
      provides by default.
    type: Text
  datacenter:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The datacenter to use. This overrides the datacenter in the provider
      setup and the agent's default datacenter.
    type: Text
  subkeys:
    required: true
    help: (Required) A mapping from subkey name (which will be appended to the given
      @path_prefix@ ) to the value that should be stored at that key. Use slashes,
      as shown in the above example, to create "sub-folders" under the given path
      prefix.

about: Allows Terraform to manage a "namespace" of Consul keys that share a common
  name prefix. Like @consul_keys@ , this resource can write values into the Consul
  key/value store, but unlike  @consul_keys@ this resource can detect and remove extra
  keys that have been added some other way, thus ensuring that rogue data added outside
  of Terraform will be removed on the next run. This resource is thus useful in the
  case where Terraform is exclusively managing a set of related keys. To avoid accidentally
  clobbering matching data that existed in Consul before a @consul_key_prefix@ resource
  was created, creation of a key prefix instance will fail if any matching keys are
  already present in the key/value store. If any conflicting data is present, you
  must first delete it manually. ~> Warning After this resource is instantiated, Terraform
  takes control over all keys with the given path prefix, and will remove any matching
  keys that are not present in the configuration. It will also delete all keys under
  the given prefix when a @consul_key_prefix@ resource is destroyed, even if those
  keys were created outside of Terraform.
